  <h2>Urban Transformation</h2>
 
 <p> Definition: <br>Urban transformation is the conversion and re-configurement of urban spaces to serve the population’s needs for both present and future. 
  This aims to conceptualise and visualise new concepts whilst preserving its heritage.<br>
 </p>
 
 <h2>8 Tallet</h2>
 <p>The Tallet 8 is a housing complex built in Orestad (Copenhagen, Denmark) in 2010, 
 overlooking the Copenhagen Canal. Shaped like the number eight, the Bjarke Ingels Group designed for complex for St. Frederikslund Holding with the intent to incorporate urban life with businesses, mimicking a mini-city with a city. 
 The complex consists of 11 storeys, 60 000 sqm in area and 476 resident housings with continuous linking paths and cycling facilities. 
</p> 

<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>The project meets the definition of an urban transformation as it converts unused green space into sustainable and livable environments for its population, whilst also reflecting Orestad’s nature of being a developing city area. 
The design of the complex allows residents to access to natural needs such as sun, air and views, but also convenient access to trade and recreational activities (playgrounds and cycling paths).
In essence, integrating necessary components of a sustainable, healthy environment into one. As it overlooks the Copenhagen Canal and Kalvebod Faelled’s protected zones, it preserves the previous environment yet also added a “green roof” to compliment its surroundings. 
Hence meeting the urban transformation definition, and also the succeeds Denmark's reputation as a highly livable “green” city.

<h2>Transformation Sucess and Data Consideration</h2>
<p>The transformation of a building can be assessed based of its statistics, revenue, population or nominations/awards. Hence aligned with its mission of urban development being a cohesive project between housing and commerce , the 8 Tallet had proven itself to be a successfully developed urban project, filling the needs of its residents. This can be proved true as the project was delivered and has received praise and awards for its innovative, sustainable design. These include: 
<ul>
  <li>2011 World Architecture Festival, Housing Building of the Year </li>
  <li>Named one of the “10 Best Architecture Moments of 2001-2010” in the Huffington Post</li>
  <li>Received the award for best “Green roof in Scandinavia” by the Scandinavian Green Roof Association</li>
  <li>The 2012 American Institute of Architects Honour Award for Architecture</li>
  <li>Was the recording grounds for the Movie, “ The infinite Happiness” by Ila Beka & Louise Lemoine</li>
</ul>  
<br>
Yet through its academic and design success, whether it is an prosperous project can be proven otherwise. Judging from photographs of the project, the promised delivery was only demonstrated by a fraction. Further investigation on the real success would depend on:
<ul>
  <li>The number of residents and businesses  </li>
  <li>Revenue of the estate </li>
  <li>The population density of Copenhagen, and whether the population is inclined to move for better opportunities</li>
  <li>Whether the estate is well connected its neighbouring districts. (Transportation)  </li>
  <li>The access to other services such as Airline and emergency services 
</li>
</ul>   
</p>

<h2>Groups in Favour, Against and their Arguments</h2>
<p> Groups in Favour:
<ul>
  <li>Bjarke Ingels Group </li>
  <li>Thomas Christoffersen (Partner)</li>
  <li>Store Frederikslund Holding</li>
  <li>Høpfner A/S </li>
  <li>Danish Oil Company A/S</li>
  <li>Copenhagen City Government</li>
</ul>

The main reason to why the project was validated by city council and was commissioned by  Store Frederikslund Holding, Høpfner A/S and Danish Oil Company A/S was to make reflect Orestad’s growth and modernist nature. Hence the Bjarke Ingels Group in partnership with Thomas Christoffersen was called to design a housing estate suitable for this characteristic, whilst taking account the modern residential needs for a citizen and embody ethical environmental practices. 

Groups Against:
<li>Environmental Lobbyists</li>
<li>General Public</li> 

A potential reason why environmental Lobbyists may be against the project could be because it lays adjust to the protected areas of  the Copenhagen Canal and Kalvebod Faelled zones. This could large building cause large areas of shade which is detrimental to the surrounding grasslands and ecology. 

The second reason would be because of Orestad’s expansive nature. Due to the heavy focus on real estate and infrastructure, it has received much criticism of this.This focus has made the city amount desolate with large open built spaces. Hence city area itself hasn’t made itself particularly attractive for human settlement.
